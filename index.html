                <h1>Hi all, I am Alex</h1>
                <p>Hi, Mi name is Alex Garcia, I go by my nickname, Penguin or you can call me Alex. 
                    I am from Mexico and I currently work as a Production Support Engineer. I would like to change
                    my career and land a developer job. For this purpose, I have been learning something new regarding
                    programming every single day since January, most of the times it has been Python and fundamental 
                    concepts such as TDD or OOP concepts, more recently HTML/CSS concepts to have a better grasp on the
                    front end development.
                </p>
                <p>I started learning python a couple of months ago as this has helped me to make some simple scripts 
                    at my current job. I am currently learning about unit testing, Test Driven Development and grasping
                    on the Object Oriented Programming concepts in Python as this will empower me to create more 
                    complex scripts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I recently enrolled into <a href="https://stackademic.com/">stackademic</a> boot camp to become
                    a full stack Web developer. Once you start programming it is hard not to come across html/css/js 
                    elements and it looks like there is a lot of things you can do if you are a fullstack web developer.
                </p>
                <p>I will leave you with a photo of my dog, his name is Tomas.</p>
